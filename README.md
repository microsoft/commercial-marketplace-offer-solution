This repository contains a set of samples and scripts that can be used a starting point for customers to build their own Azure Marketplace offerings.

## Prerequisites
The samples and scripts in this repository uses the following tools:
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

- [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Please refer to the setup scripts for your operating system for easy installation:
- [Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)](setup/linux_ubuntu_debian.sh)
- [Linux (CentOS/RHEL)](setup/linux_centos_rhel.sh)
- [macOS](setup/macos.sh) - installs and uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install tools.
- [Windows](setup/windows.ps1) - installs and uses [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (default) to install tools. To install without Chocolatey, run `./windows.ps1 -useChocolatey $false`.

### Azure Partner Center CLI Installation

The Azure Partner Center CLI requires Python 3.7+ to be installed. Please [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the appropriate version of Python and install it on your system. Once Python is installed, create a virtual environment ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)) and install the following packages:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install az-partner-center-cli
```

Here's an example using `venv`:

```
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install az-partner-center-cli

# to deactivate
deactivate
```

## Samples
Use the following samples to build your own Azure Marketplace offerings. Each sample includes a README file that contains instructions on how to build the sample and modify it for your use case.

### [Solution Template with Custom Script Extension](samples/solution-template/base-image-vm/README.md)

This sample demonstrates how to build a solution template Azure Application offer. This sample deploys a Windows Server 2019 VM and runs a custom script extension that writes content to a file. The custom script extension runs a PowerShell script after the VM has been provisioned.

### [Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine with Added Tools](samples/virtual-machine/basic-windows-vm/README.md)

This sample demonstrates how to create a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine image with Chocolatey and Microsoft Edge installed. The image can then be used to create an Azure Virtual Machine offer.

### Future Work
This repository is still under development. We are working to add more scripts for testing and automation.
